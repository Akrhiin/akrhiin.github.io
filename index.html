                <p>Before focusing my studies on computer science, I spent time in both the life and physical sciences, as well as the arts.  I find joy in bringing different perspectives to projects, and working to integrate those ideas into both new and existing solutions.</p>
                <p>I enjoy both the hardware and software sides of computing, with prior experience in information technology and networking, software development, and data analytics.  Lately, one of my biggest interests has been studying embedded systems and microcontrollers; there's a certain satisfaction to writing code to work in a restrictive environment (memory or otherwise), and even more so when creating that environment yourself.</p>
                <p>My greatest goal is to be able to make a living by committing my time and knowledge to work that helps people, and I believe that with technology becoming more and more integrated into our lives in a positive way, that goal is always becoming a bit more possible.</p>
